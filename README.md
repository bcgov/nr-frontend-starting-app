# Front-end Starting App

This is a starting front-end app that intends to get the team started with code definitions, commits standards and guides related to code-style.

In case you're looking for the original readme template file, you can see it [here](README_template.md)

TODO: update package.json file

## Stack

- React
- Redux!?
- Styled Components
- Jest
- Cypress

## Getting started with the environment

All you need is an IDE, we recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio](http://link.com), and a recent version of NodeJS.

## Running the app

Before run the application you must install the dependencies. To do that, run:
- `yarn install`

Then you can start a development server
- `npm run dev`

## Running Tests

We're using **jest** and **cypress** to run tests. You can run with:
- `npm run test`

## Commits Standards

There's a hook that will run before each commit, to make sure the commit message, title and body, if present, will be in compliance with the standards.

## Internal TODO

- [ ] Finish this readme file
- [ ] Adjust the package.json file
- [ ] Add a starting code-base
- [ ] Add tests
