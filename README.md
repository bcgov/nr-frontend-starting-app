# Natural Resources Front-End Starting Progressive Web Application

This repository holds a set of policies, standard, guides and pipelines to get
started with a Progressive Web Application. Before writing your first line of code, please take a
moment and check out our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

## Our Policy

- Work in the open: That means that everything we do should be open, should be
public. Please, don't create private repositories unless you have a very strong
reason. Keeping things public is a must follow rule for BC Government.
- Customer centred services: All the work that's been created is to improve
users, customers, and friends usability and experience. Is important to keep
that in mind, because as engineers sometimes we face technical issues, however, our goal is to have a good product.
- Community based work: Remember that you're not alone. It's very likely that
your problem is someone else's problem. Let's figure it out together. So, ask
a question using our channels. We have [our own Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.developer.gov.bc.ca/)
and [our Rocket Chat](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/) channel.
